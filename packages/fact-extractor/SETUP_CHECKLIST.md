## What Claude Code Can Now Do

### Automatic Capabilities

When you ask Claude to work on DSPy components:

- [x] Reference Signature design patterns
- [x] Suggest Module architecture improvements
- [x] Understand ChainOfThought reasoning
- [x] Know about LLM adapter patterns
- [x] Understand prompt optimization concepts
- [x] Reference multi-step reasoning examples

### Example Usage

Try these queries in Claude Code:

1. **"Improve the FactExtraction signature"**
   - Claude will reference signature patterns from llms.txt

2. **"How can we support multiple LLM providers?"**
   - Claude will reference adapter patterns

3. **"Optimize the extraction pipeline"**
   - Claude will suggest DSPy optimization approaches

4. **"Refactor FactExtractor as a proper DSPy Module"**
   - Claude will reference module design patterns

## Next Steps for Users

### Immediate (Do Now)

- [x] Read LLMS_TXT_USAGE.md to understand usage
- [x] Note the file location
- [ ] Start using it in Claude Code sessions

### Soon (This Week)

- [ ] Try asking Claude about DSPy improvements
- [ ] Reference llms.txt patterns in discussions
- [ ] Share with team members

### Later (Ongoing)

- [ ] Keep llms.txt updated as DSPy evolves
- [ ] Add new patterns your team discovers
- [ ] Reference it in code reviews
- [ ] Use as training material for team

## Git Integration

When ready to commit:

```bash
git add llms.txt LLMS_TXT_USAGE.md INSTALLATION_SUMMARY.md SETUP_CHECKLIST.md
git commit -m "Add DSPy framework reference for Claude Code understanding"
git push
```

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code doesn't find llms.txt

- [x] Verify file is in project root: `M:\GitHub\esia-fact-extractor\llms.txt`
- [x] Restart Claude Code session
- [x] Check file permissions (should be readable)

### References to llms.txt seem generic

- [x] File may be cold - ask specific DSPy questions
- [x] Try: "Per the DSPy patterns in llms.txt..."
- [x] Context builds as you ask more questions

### Need to update llms.txt

- [x] Edit the file with new DSPy patterns
- [x] Keep format consistent
- [x] Commit changes to git
- [x] Restart Claude Code to use updated version

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

✓ Claude suggests DSPy-specific patterns
✓ Claude understands your signatures better
✓ Suggestions align with DSPy best practices
✓ Claude references documented patterns
✓ Conversations about DSPy are more informed
