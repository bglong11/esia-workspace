# Sample ESIA Report - Coal Mining Project

## Executive Summary

The proposed coal mining project will extract coal from the Blackstone deposit in the Central Province. The project will produce **1.23 million tonnes per year** of thermal coal over a 25-year operational period.

The mine footprint covers approximately **450 hectares** of land, including the open pit, processing facilities, and infrastructure.

## Project Description

### Production Capacity

The coal production will be 1.23 Mt/yr with an energy content of approximately 5,500 kcal/kg. The mine will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Peak power demand for the project is estimated at **15 MW**, with an annual energy consumption of approximately 120,000 MWh/yr.

### Water Management

Total water consumption is projected at **2.5 million litres per day** for dust suppression, coal washing, and domestic use. A water treatment plant with capacity of 3 ML/day will be constructed.

Treated wastewater will meet discharge standards with TSS < 50 mg/L and pH between 6.5-8.5.

### Land Use

The project requires clearing of 450 ha of vegetation, comprising:
- Open pit: 280 hectares
- Processing plant: 45 ha
- Infrastructure and roads: 75 hectares
- Water management: 50 ha

A rehabilitation bond of $12 million has been allocated for progressive rehabilitation.

## Environmental Baseline

### Air Quality

Background PM10 concentrations average 35 µg/m³, with PM2.5 at 18 µg/m³. The project will implement dust control measures to maintain ambient PM10 below 50 µg/m³.

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Scope 1 emissions from mining operations are estimated at **450,000 tonnes CO2-e per year**. Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity will contribute an additional 95,000 t CO2-e/yr.

Total project emissions: 545,000 tonnes CO2-e annually.

### Biodiversity

The project area contains habitat for 12 threatened species. A 200-hectare offset area will be established to compensate for habitat loss.

## Social Impact

### Employment

The project will create 350 full-time jobs during operations, with peak construction employment of 800 workers. Local employment target is 60%.

### Community Investment

A community development fund of $500,000 per annum will support education, health, and infrastructure programs in surrounding villages.

## Water Quality Standards

Discharge limits for treated effluent:
- Total Suspended Solids: 50 mg/L
- Chemical Oxygen Demand: 120 mg/L
- Total Nitrogen: 15 mg/L
- Total Phosphorus: 2 mg/L
- pH: 6.5 - 8.5

### Groundwater

Baseline groundwater quality shows TDS of 450 mg/L and sulfate at 85 mg/L. Monitoring will occur at 15 bore locations quarterly.

## Conflicting Data Test

Note: The following contains intentional conflicts for QC testing:

The project area is 450 hectares according to the mine plan, but the land acquisition documents show 4,500 ha.

Coal production is stated as 1.23 Mt/yr in the executive summary but appears as 12.3 Mt/yr in the financial model (potential decimal error).

Water consumption is 2.5 ML/day in Section 3, but 2,500 L/day is mentioned in the water balance table (potential unit error).
